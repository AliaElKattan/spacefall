<h2>Spacefall</h2>

We made Spacefall VR shortly after SpaceX launched a Tesla roadster into space as a satirical take on the live stream and an exploration of how VR can quickly transport us to alternate universes. Within a few weeks of the launch, we built a first-person experience where the user becomes the person in the car, and rides around in space with the ability to only do two things: steer the wheel, or play music. The experience lasts for 5 minutes - the time remaining before oxygen runs out - and is meant to be a peaceful time where users relax, enjoy the view, and enjoy the game mechanics.

Built with <b>Peter Si</b> and <b>Miha Klasinc</b>.
